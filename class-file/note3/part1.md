**1. Objects and Prototypes**

In JavaScript, objects and prototypes are fundamental concepts that form the basis of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). Understanding how objects and prototypes work is crucial for building robust and maintainable JavaScript applications.

**Objects:**

In JavaScript, an object is a collection of key-value pairs, where keys are strings (or symbols) and values can be of any data type, including other objects, functions, arrays, etc. Objects in JavaScript can be created using object literals, constructors, or classes (in ES6 and later).

```javascript
// Object literal
const person = {
  name: 'John',
  age: 30,
  greet() {
    console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.name}`);
  }
};

// Constructor function
function Person(name, age) {
  this.name = name; 
  this.age = age;
}

// Class (ES6)
class Person {
  constructor(name, age) {
    this.name = name;
    this.age = age;
  }
}
```

**Prototypes:**

Prototypes are a mechanism in JavaScript that allows objects to inherit properties and methods from other objects. Every object in JavaScript has an internal prototype (referred to as `__proto__`) that it inherits properties and methods from.

```javascript
// Using prototypes to add methods to objects
function Person(name, age) {
  this.name = name;
  this.age = age;
}

Person.prototype.greet = function() {
  console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.name}`);
};

const john = new Person('John', 30);
john.greet(); // Output: Hello, my name is John
```

Prototypes are used extensively in JavaScript to implement inheritance and share behavior among objects efficiently.

**Benefits of Objects and Prototypes:**

- **Code Reusability:** Objects and prototypes facilitate code reusability by allowing properties and methods to be shared among objects.
- **Encapsulation:** Objects encapsulate related data and behavior, making the code more modular and easier to manage.
- **Inheritance:** Prototypal inheritance allows objects to inherit properties and methods from other objects, enabling hierarchical relationships and code reuse.
