**2. Constructors and Classes (ES6)**

Constructors and classes in JavaScript provide syntactic sugar for creating objects and implementing object-oriented programming principles. They offer a more structured and intuitive way to define and instantiate objects.

**Constructors:**

In traditional JavaScript, constructors are functions used to create and initialize objects. They are invoked with the `new` keyword to create new instances of objects.

```javascript
// Constructor function
function Person(name, age) {
  this.name = name;
  this.age = age;
}

// Creating new instances
const john = new Person('John', 30);
const jane = new Person('Jane', 25);
```

Constructors can be thought of as blueprints for creating objects, where each instance inherits properties and methods defined within the constructor.

**Classes (ES6):**

ES6 introduced a class syntax that provides a more familiar and intuitive way to define constructors and implement inheritance in JavaScript.

```javascript
// Class definition
class Person {
  constructor(name, age) {
    this.name = name;
    this.age = age;
  }
}

// Creating new instances
const john = new Person('John', 30);
const jane = new Person('Jane', 25);
```

Under the hood, classes in JavaScript are still based on prototypes, providing a more concise and expressive way to work with objects.

**Key Differences:**

- **Syntax:** Classes provide a more concise and readable syntax for defining constructors and creating objects.
- **Inheritance:** Classes support extends keyword for implementing inheritance, whereas constructors rely on prototype chaining for inheritance.

**Benefits of Constructors and Classes:**

- **Simplicity:** Constructors and classes offer a straightforward and intuitive way to define and instantiate objects.
- **Encapsulation:** They encapsulate related data and behavior within objects, promoting code organization and modularity.
- **Inheritance:** Classes support inheritance, allowing objects to inherit properties and methods from other objects, facilitating code reuse and extension.
