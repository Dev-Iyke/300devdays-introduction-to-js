## 1. Arithmetic Operators:
JavaScript supports standard arithmetic operators for basic mathematical operations.

```javascript
let a = 5;
let b = 2;

let sum = a + b;  // Addition
let difference = a - b;  // Subtraction
let product = a * b;  // Multiplication
let quotient = a / b;  // Division
let remainder = a % b;  // Remainder
let exponentiation = a ** b;  // Exponentiation
```

## 2. Remainder Operator:
The remainder operator (`%`) returns the remainder of a division operation.

```javascript
let remainder = 10 % 3;  // Result: 1
```

## 3. Assignment Operators:
Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables.

```javascript
let x = 5;

x += 3;  // Equivalent to x = x + 3
x -= 2;  // Equivalent to x = x - 2
x *= 4;  // Equivalent to x = x * 4
x /= 2;  // Equivalent to x = x / 2
```

## 4. Unary Operators:
Unary operators operate on a single operand.

```javascript
let num = 10;

num++;  // Increment by 1
num--;  // Decrement by 1
let negation = -num;  // Negation
```

## 5. Comparison Operators:
Comparison operators are used to compare values.

```javascript
let a = 5;
let b = 8;

console.log(a > b);  // Greater than
console.log(a < b);  // Less than
console.log(a >= b);  // Greater than or equal to
console.log(a <= b);  // Less than or equal to
console.log(a === b);  // Equal to (strict)
console.log(a !== b);  // Not equal to (strict)
```

## 6. Logical Operators:
Logical operators are used to combine or modify logical values.

```javascript
let isTrue = true;
let isFalse = false;

console.log(isTrue && isFalse);  // Logical AND
console.log(isTrue || isFalse);  // Logical OR
console.log(!isTrue);  // Logical NOT
```

## 7. Logical Assignment Operators:
Logical assignment operators combine logical operations with assignment.

```javascript
let x = 5;

x &&= 3;  // Equivalent to x = x && 3
x ||= 8;  // Equivalent to x = x || 8
```

## 8. Nullish Coalescing Operator:
The nullish coalescing operator (`??`) returns the right-hand operand when the left-hand operand is null or undefined.

```javascript
let x = null;
let y = 5;

let result = x ?? y;  // Result: 5
```

## 9. Exponentiation Operator:
The exponentiation operator (`**`) raises the left operand to the power of the right operand.

```javascript
let base = 2;
let exponent = 3;

let result = base ** exponent;  // Result: 8
```
