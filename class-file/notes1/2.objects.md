1. **Object Creation:**
   In JavaScript, an object is an unordered collection of key-value pairs, with each pair referred to as a property. Properties can have various values, including strings, numbers, arrays, and even functions. The object literal notation is the most commonly used method for creating objects:

   ```javascript
   // Creating an empty object
   let empty = {};

   // Creating an object with properties
   let person = {
       firstName: 'John',
       lastName: 'Doe'
   };
   ```

2. **Accessing Properties:**
   Objects provide two primary notations for accessing properties â€“ the dot notation (.) and the array-like notation ([]).

   ```javascript
   // Dot notation
   console.log(person.firstName); // Output: John

   // Array-like notation
   console.log(person['lastName']); // Output: Doe
   ```

   It's important to note that array-like notation is essential when dealing with property names containing spaces.

3. **Modifying and Adding Properties:**
   To modify the value of an existing property, use the assignment operator. New properties can be added to an object even after its creation:

   ```javascript
   // Modifying a property
   person.firstName = 'Jane';

   // Adding a new property
   person.age = 25;
   ```

4. **Deleting Properties:**
   The `delete` operator allows you to remove a property from an object:

   ```javascript
   // Deleting a property
   delete person.age;
   ```

   Be cautious when using `delete`, as attempting to access a deleted property will result in `undefined`.

5. **Checking Property Existence:**
   The `in` operator is used to check if a property exists in an object:

   ```javascript
   // Checking property existence
   console.log('ssn' in employee); // Output: false
   console.log('employeeId' in employee); // Output: true
   ```

   This is useful for conditional checks before accessing properties.
