# Object-Oriented Programming with JavaScript

Let's explore the key concepts of OOP in JavaScript, including examples of inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphism, private methods, public methods, and static methods.

## 1. Objects in JavaScript

In JavaScript, everything is an object or can be treated as an object. Objects are instances of classes and can have properties and methods.

## 2. Creating Objects

You can create objects using object literals or constructor functions.

```javascript
// Using object literal
let person = {
  name: 'John Doe',
  age: 25,
  greet: function() {
    console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.name}.`);
  }
};

// Using constructor function
function Person(name, age) {
  this.name = name;
  this.age = age;
}

Person.prototype.greet = function() {
  console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.name}.`);
};

let john = new Person('John Doe', 25);
john.greet();
```

## 3. Prototypes and Inheritance

JavaScript uses prototypes for inheritance. Objects can inherit properties and methods from other objects.

```javascript
// Inheritance using prototypes
function Student(name, age, grade) {
  Person.call(this, name, age);
  this.grade = grade;
}

Student.prototype = Object.create(Person.prototype);
Student.prototype.constructor = Student;

let alice = new Student('Alice Smith', 20, 'A');
alice.greet();
```

## 4. Encapsulation

Encapsulation is the bundling of data and the methods that operate on that data into a single unit, often referred to as a class.

```javascript
// Encapsulation using constructor function
function Car(make, model) {
  let speed = 0; // private variable

  this.getSpeed = function() {
    return speed;
  };

  this.accelerate = function(amount) {
    speed += amount;
  };

  this.brake = function(amount) {
    speed = Math.max(0, speed - amount);
  };

  this.getInfo = function() {
    return `${make} ${model}, current speed: ${speed} km/h`;
  };
}

let myCar = new Car('Toyota', 'Camry');
myCar.accelerate(30);
console.log(myCar.getInfo());
```

## 5. Polymorphism

Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common class.

```javascript
// Polymorphism with method overriding
Person.prototype.introduce = function() {
  console.log(`Hi, I am ${this.name}.`);
};

Student.prototype.introduce = function() {
  console.log(`Hi, I am ${this.name} and I am a student.`);
};

john.introduce();
alice.introduce();
```

## 6. Private and Public Methods

JavaScript doesn't have built-in support for private and public access modifiers, but conventions and closures can be used to achieve similar effects.

```javascript
// Private and Public Methods
function Counter() {
  let count = 0; // private variable

  function increment() {
    count++;
  }

  this.getCount = function() {
    increment(); // private method can be called from public method
    return count;
  };
}

let myCounter = new Counter();
console.log(myCounter.getCount());
```

## 7. Static Methods

Static methods are associated with the class itself rather than instances of the class.

```javascript
// Static Method
function MathUtils() {}

MathUtils.add = function(a, b) {
  return a + b;
};

console.log(MathUtils.add(2, 3));
```
