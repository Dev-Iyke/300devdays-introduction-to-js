# Object-Oriented Programming with JavaScript Using Classes

We'll explore the key concepts of OOP in JavaScript using classes, including examples of inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphism, private methods, public methods, and static methods.

## 1. Classes in JavaScript

A class is a blueprint for creating objects with shared properties and methods.

```javascript
// Class declaration
class Person {
  constructor(name, age) {
    this.name = name;
    this.age = age;
  }

  greet() {
    console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.name}.`);
  }
}
```

## 2. Creating Classes

You can create instances of classes using the `new` keyword.

```javascript
// Creating instances
let john = new Person('John Doe', 25);
john.greet();
```

## 3. Inheritance with Classes

Classes support inheritance, allowing one class to inherit from another.

```javascript
// Inheritance with classes
class Student extends Person {
  constructor(name, age, grade) {
    super(name, age);
    this.grade = grade;
  }

  // Overriding the greet method
  greet() {
    console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.name}, and I am a student.`);
  }
}

let alice = new Student('Alice Smith', 20, 'A');
alice.greet();
```

## 4. Encapsulation

Encapsulation is achieved through the use of constructor functions and private properties.

```javascript
// Encapsulation with classes
class Car {
  #speed = 0; // private variable

  accelerate(amount) {
    this.#speed += amount;
  }

  brake(amount) {
    this.#speed = Math.max(0, this.#speed - amount);
  }

  getInfo() {
    return `Current speed: ${this.#speed} km/h`;
  }
}

let myCar = new Car();
myCar.accelerate(30);
console.log(myCar.getInfo());
```

## 5. Polymorphism

Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common class.

```javascript
// Polymorphism with method overriding
class Animal {
  speak() {
    console.log('Animal speaks');
  }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
  speak() {
    console.log('Dog barks');
  }
}

let myAnimal = new Dog();
myAnimal.speak();
```

## 6. Private and Public Methods

JavaScript classes have built-in support for public methods, but private methods can be achieved using naming conventions.

```javascript
// Private and Public Methods
class Counter {
  #count = 0; // private variable

  #increment() {
    this.#count++;
  }

  getCount() {
    this.#increment(); // private method can be called from public method
    return this.#count;
  }
}

let myCounter = new Counter();
console.log(myCounter.getCount());
```

## 7. Static Methods

Static methods are associated with the class itself rather than instances of the class.

```javascript
// Static Method
class MathUtils {
  static add(a, b) {
    return a + b;
  }
}

console.log(MathUtils.add(2, 3));
```
