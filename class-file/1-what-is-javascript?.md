# What is Javascript?

JavaScript is a programming language that is primarily used for creating interactive and dynamic content on websites. It is an essential part of web development and allows you to add functionality, manipulate the content of a webpage, and respond to user actions.

Here's a simple breakdown for newbies:

1. **What is JavaScript?**
   - JavaScript is a scripting language that enables you to make your website more interactive.
   - It runs on the client side, meaning it operates within your web browser.

2. ###### **What can you do with JavaScript?**
   
   - **Dynamic Content:** You can change the content of a webpage on the fly. For example, you can update text, images, or other elements without reloading the entire page.
   - **User Interaction:** JavaScript allows you to respond to user actions such as clicks, key presses, and mouse movements.
   - **Form Validation:** You can validate user inputs in forms before submitting them to ensure they meet certain criteria.
   - ###### **Animations:** You can create animations and transitions to enhance the visual experience of your website.
   
3. **How is JavaScript used?**
   - You embed JavaScript code directly into your HTML documents or link to external JavaScript files.
   - Example within HTML:
     ```html
     <script>
       // Your JavaScript code goes here
       alert('Hello, World!');
     </script>
     ```
   - Example linking to an external JavaScript file:
     ```html
     <script src="script.js"></script>
     ```

4. **Basic Syntax:**
   - JavaScript code is written in plain text and follows a specific syntax. Here's a simple example:
     ```javascript
     // Declare a variable
     let greeting = "Hello, World!";
     
     // Display an alert with the variable value
     alert(greeting);
     ```

5. **Where does JavaScript run?**
   - JavaScript runs in the browser, meaning it is executed on the user's device. This is different from server-side languages like PHP or Python, which run on the web server.

6. **Frameworks and Libraries:**
   - JavaScript has many frameworks and libraries (e.g., React, Angular, Vue.js) that make it easier to build complex web applications by providing pre-built components and structures.
